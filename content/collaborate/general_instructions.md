To collaborate in the further versions of AFLIBER, please send an email to 
atlasfloraiberica@gmail.com attaching .csv or .xlsx files with your contributions. 
Note that,
depending on the case, several documents may be needed (if you want a new 
species to appear, not only the taxonomic information should be provided, but 
also its related distributional information). Please consider to use the 
collaboration forms we provide to facilitate data homogenization, and formatting 
file titles with your name at the end. For example, if I wanted to send a new 
species, I would have to modify “AFLIBER_new_species_BLANK.csv” and send it as 
“AFLIBER_new_species_Ramos-Gutierrez.csv”, along a modification of 
“AFLIBER_new_distributions_BLANK.csv” sent as 
“AFLIBER_new_distributions_Ramos-Gutierrez.csv”.

#### Suggestions
For suggestions or other issues you can use the mail form on the top right 
corner of the website. Notice that attachments cannot be provided within 
the online mail form.
