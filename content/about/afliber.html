<p>AFLIBER is a comprehensive database connecting the up-to-date species list of
the Iberian-Balearic vascular native flora with its matching occurrence records
rescaled to a standard UTM 10-km grain resolution. Born as a datapaper
(currently under review), the
goal of AFLIBER is to be a running atlas, in which new taxonomical and
distributional information can be added and updated.</p>
<p>This project was performed under the funding of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the Bioregions 2.0 project (CGL2017-86926-P).</p>
