AFLIBER is a comprehensive database connecting the up-to-date species list of 
the Iberian-Balearic vascular native flora with its matching occurrence records 
rescaled to a standard UTM 10-km grain resolution. Born as a datapaper 
(currently under review), the 
goal of AFLIBER is to be a running atlas, in which new taxonomical and 
distributional information can be added and updated.

This project was performed under the funding of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the Bioregions 2.0 project (CGL2017-86926-P).
