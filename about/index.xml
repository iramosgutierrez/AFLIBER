      <description>AFLIBER is a comprehensive database connecting the up-to-date species list of the Iberian-Balearic vascular native flora with its matching occurrence records rescaled to a standard UTM 10-km grain resolution. Born as a datapaper (currently under review), the goal of AFLIBER is to be a running atlas, in which new taxonomical and distributional information can be added and updated.
This project was performed under the funding of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the Bioregions 2.</description>

I am PhD student whose research consists in the application of new biogeographical tools over Iberian Flora databases. Previously, I worked on the conservation status of the giant orchid (Himantoglossum robertianum) in Madrid and also on the phylogeography of Nepeta hispanica, a threatened plant of the Iberian Peninsula and Morroco.
