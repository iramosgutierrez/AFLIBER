      <description>This section is under construction   AFLIBER is a comprehensive database connecting the up-to-date species list of the Iberian-Balearic vascular native flora with its matching occurrence records rescaled to a standard UTM 10-km grain resolution. Born as a datapaper, the objective of AFLIBER is to be a running atlas, in which new taxonomical and distributional information can be added and updated research can be used to correct potential mistakes.</description>

My research focuses on the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that jointly shape plant assemblages at the community and macroecological scales. I am also interested in understanding the links between plant biodiversity and human well-being, with a particular focus on the role that evolution pays in this relationship.</description>
